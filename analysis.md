Wallet Credit Score Analysis
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol, based on their historical transaction behavior. The scores range from 0 to 1000, aiming to differentiate between reliable and risky users.

Score Distribution
The credit scores generated by the model show a particular distribution across the wallet population.

[YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Describe the shape of the histogram. Is it skewed? Are there distinct peaks? For example: "The distribution of credit scores is [e.g., right-skewed, left-skewed, normally distributed around a certain mean]. A significant portion of wallets fall within the [e.g., 400-600] range, indicating typical user behavior. There are [e.g., fewer, more] wallets in the extreme low and high ranges, suggesting that highly risky or highly responsible behaviors are [e.g., less, more] common."

[YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Discuss the ranges:

0-100: [e.g., Very few wallets, indicating extreme negative behavior.]

100-200: [e.g., A small cluster of wallets, likely involved in some risky activities.]

200-300: [e.g., A noticeable group, potentially users with some minor issues or new risky patterns.]

300-400: [e.g., Average-to-slightly-below-average users.]

400-500: [e.g., The core average user group.]

500-600: [e.g., Slightly above average, showing good habits.]

600-700: [e.g., Consistently good users.]

700-800: [e.g., Very good users, demonstrating strong responsibility.]

800-900: [e.g., Excellent users with highly responsible behavior.]

900-1000: [e.g., A healthy number of wallets, representing highly reliable users with exemplary behavior.]

Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Score Range (0-300)
Wallets receiving lower credit scores typically exhibit characteristics associated with risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.

Key Observations for Low-Scoring Wallets:

Liquidations: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Describe the prevalence and frequency of liquidationcall events. For example: "A defining characteristic of low-scoring wallets is a high incidence of liquidationcall events. Many wallets in this range have experienced multiple liquidations, indicating poor collateral management or highly leveraged positions that failed. Some might even show patterns of being liquidated shortly after borrowing, suggesting speculative or irresponsible behavior."

Repayment Ratio: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Discuss their repayment behavior. For example: "These wallets often show very low or zero repayment_ratio, suggesting they either do not repay their borrows, or only do so after significant delays or partial liquidations. This indicates a failure to honor their financial obligations within the protocol."

Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Comment on their leverage. For example: "Many low-scoring wallets exhibit an extremely high borrow_to_deposit_ratio, indicating they are heavily leveraged relative to their deposits, making them highly susceptible to market fluctuations and increasing their risk of liquidation."

Account Age & Activity: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Are they new or old? Very active or sporadic? For example: "Some low-scoring wallets are relatively new accounts with a burst of activity (e.g., large borrows) followed by liquidations, potentially indicative of risky 'pump-and-dump' or highly speculative strategies. Others might be older but consistently engage in high-risk actions, showing a pattern of irresponsible behavior over time."

Net Flow: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: Is their net deposit flow negative? For example: "Often, these wallets have a negative net_deposit_flow_usd, meaning they have withdrawn more value than they deposited, possibly through undercollateralized borrows that were not fully repaid, effectively extracting liquidity from the protocol."

Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Score Range (700-1000)
Wallets with high credit scores generally demonstrate reliable, responsible, and sustained engagement with the Aave V2 protocol.

Key Observations for High-Scoring Wallets:

Liquidations: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: For example: "High-scoring wallets show a near-zero or absolute zero num_liquidations, indicating meticulous risk management and proactive collateral maintenance. They effectively manage their positions to avoid liquidation events."

Repayment Ratio: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: For example: "These wallets consistently maintain a repayment_ratio at or above 1.0, signifying timely and full repayment of their borrowed funds. Many even show repayment_ratio slightly above 1.0, indicating over-repayment or early repayments, which is a strong sign of reliability."

Total Deposits & Net Flow: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: For example: "High-scoring wallets typically have substantial total_deposit_usd and a positive net_deposit_flow_usd, acting as net liquidity providers to the protocol. They contribute more to the liquidity pool than they withdraw."

Account Age & Activity: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: For example: "They often represent older accounts with a high total_transactions count and diverse num_unique_actions, reflecting long-term, consistent, and varied interaction with the protocol. This indicates a stable and experienced user."

Borrowing Behavior: [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]: For example: "While they may borrow, their borrow_to_deposit_ratio is usually conservative, and their borrowing is often followed by prompt repayment, indicating strategic and responsible leverage rather than reckless speculation."

Conclusion
The credit scoring model, based on engineered features from Aave V2 transaction data, effectively distinguishes between different wallet behaviors. The analysis of score ranges confirms that key metrics like liquidations, repayment ratios, and overall financial flow are strong indicators of a wallet's reliability and risk profile within the DeFi ecosystem. This framework provides a transparent and extensible method for assessing wallet creditworthiness, offering valuable insights into user behavior within decentralized finance protocols.

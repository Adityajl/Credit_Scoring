# Credit_Scoring
This project develops a credit score (0-1000) for Aave V2 DeFi wallets. It analyzes transaction data (deposits, borrows, liquidations) to engineer behavioral features. A rule-based model then assigns scores, identifying reliable vs. risky users. Outputs include scores, analysis, and a score distribution plot.
